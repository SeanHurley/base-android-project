base-android-project
====================

A simple base to get started on a new android app.

Summary
--------------------

I always find myself spinning up simple little android apps
to try something out. They usually end up having similar
dependencies (butterknife, retrofit, etc), so I always spend
like a half hour to an hour getting those set up. This is a
nice base to start from that has those ready to go.
